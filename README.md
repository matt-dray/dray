# dray

It's a practice package that I'll put some personal functions in, y'all.

Follows the advice of [Hilary Parker's excellent blog](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) and [Karl Broman's package primer](https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/).

Install with `devtools::install_github("matt-dray/dray")` and call into your workspace with `library(dray)`.

Requires R version >=3.4.3.
