## Purpose

This is a work-in-development package to learn how to make packages. The functions and data are pretty trivial (and possibly silly) and mostly for my own amusement.

The package has been used in various blogs and personal projects. For example, the:

* `cloud_pie` function was used in [my blogpost *Cloudy with a Chance of Pie*](https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/05/25/cloud-pie/)
* `phd` data was used in [my blogpost *Markov-chaining my PhD* blogpost](https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/06/30/markov-chain-phd/)
* `pkmn_go` data is to be implemented in [my document *Beginner R and RStudio Training (featuring Pokemon)*](https://matt-dray.github.io/beginner-r-feat-pkmn/)
* `ye_cols` vector was used in [my blogpost *Tid-ye-text with `geniusr`*](https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/06/05/tid-ye-text/)

## Installation

Install with `devtools::install_github("matt-dray/dray")` and call into your workspace with `library(dray)`.

## Gratitude

The package was developed using advice from:

* [Hilary Parker's *Writing an R Package from Scratch* blog](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/)
* [Karl Broman's *R Package Primer* tutorial](https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/)
* [Hadley Wickham's *R Packages* book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/)
